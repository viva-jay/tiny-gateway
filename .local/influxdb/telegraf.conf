  ## Collection jitter is used to jitter the collection by a random amount.

  ## Jitter the flush interval by a random amount. This is primarily to avoid

  ## Collected metrics are rounded to the precision specified. Precision is

  ## Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s".
  ##
  ## By default or when set to "0s", precision will be set to the same
  ## timestamp order as the collection interval, with the maximum being 1s:
  ##   ie, when interval = "10s", precision will be "1s"
  ##       when interval = "250ms", precision will be "1ms"

  ## service input to set the timestamp at the appropriate precision.
